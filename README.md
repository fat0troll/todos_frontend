# todos_frontend

Simple todos application frontend created for skill-testing purposes

This application runs as standard Webpacked Vue.js app. It assumes that backend is located on ``http://localhost:3000``, and frontend is on ``http://localhost:8080``.

## Timeline of development

* 0h15m: Started from Vue.js webpack template. I'm using Bulma as CSS framework as I don't have special requirements in this field and may choose what I want.
* 1h40m: Added login support and cookies
* 2h10m: Added registration form
* 3h10m: Added todos index and ability to publish todo for everyone
* 3h50m: Added new todo form
* 4h20m: Added tasks list, ability to edit them, mark them done and add new one

This timeline doesn't include time for learning ``Vue.js`` itself.
